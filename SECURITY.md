# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is very important to us.

If you have discovered a security issue, please contact hello@p2pigeon.com directly. Please refrain from directly creating a GitHub issue and publicly disclosing the vulnerability.
We prefer a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) to properly understand and fix the root cause problem.

Your report should include:

-   Product version ([GitHub](https://github.com/MoonBaseDAO/pigeon-app/commits/master) commit hash.
-   The affected component if possible (client.js, server.js, etc.)
-   A vulnerability description
-   Reproduction steps

A member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, determine its impact, and develop a fix.
The fix will be applied to the master branch, tested, and packaged in the next security release.

Thanks in advance for your support to make our products safer!
